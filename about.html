                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an Information Technology student aiming to specialize in cybersecurity. I am currently
                    building foundational skills in Linux, networking, and security concepts through hands-on practice
                    and structured self-study.

                <ul>
                    <li>Operating Systems: Linux (Kali, PopOS)</li>
                    <li>Virtualization: VirtualBox</li>

                        Tools: Basic Linux command-line utilities and security-focused learning
                        platforms
                    </li>

                <h2>Learning Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    I focus on learning cybersecurity by analyzing real systems, documenting observations, and
                    understanding security risks from both a defensive and analytical perspective. I value clarity,
                    correctness, and steady skill development over superficial complexity.
